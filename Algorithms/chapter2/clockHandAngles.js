// Create clockHandAngles(seconds) that, given a number of seconds 
// since 12:00:00, prints angles (in degrees) of the hour, minute and
// seconds hands. As review, 360 degreed form a full rotation. 
// For input of 3600 secs (equivalent to 1:00:00), print 
// "Hour hand: 360 degs. Minute hand: 93 degs. Second hand: 180 degs".
// Note: in the second example, the angle for the minute hand is not
// simply 90 degs; it has advanced a bit further, because of the additional
// 30 secs in that minute so far.
